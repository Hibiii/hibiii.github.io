This is a test blog post. If you can see this then everything works! This should
be here, even in production.


Why is this here?
=================

I believe everything, and I mean *everything* that people are expected to use
without supervision should have an "identity" use, the simplest way to use it
without necessarily any meaning.

Programmers call them hello-worlds, mathematicians call them identity functions,
normal people call them "doing nothing".

The answer I want to ask with this blog post is: "what's the correct way to do
nothing?"
