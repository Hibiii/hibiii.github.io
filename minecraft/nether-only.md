<mark class="note">Page under construction: This page will probably be under
construction forever as I get more experience with this playstyle, and due to
the fact this is one behemoth of a page. Sorry!</mark>

Living in the nether is already difficult even starting in the overworld. It is
very possible to survive the Nether (even the old one), but is it possible to
thrive?

<h2 id="the-basics" o="1">The Basics</h2>
<h3 id="getting-woood" o="1.1">Getting Wood &amp; Benchmarking</h3>

The most important step in Minecraft is getting wood. From tick 0, you'll be met
with hostile mobs. The most friendly of them are Endermen (spawning mostly in
Warped Forests) and Zombie Pigmen, being neutral to the player.

You have a decent but not high chance of spawning near forests. Crimson Forests
at the beginning are highly dangerous as unforgiving Piglins and Hogs inhabit
them. Warped Fungi will keep Hoglins away from you, but not Piglins. To keep
Piglins away from you, without gold armor, you'll need Zombie Pigmen, which only
spawn in Wastes. You can *usually* find Wastes neighboring Crimson Forests but
there are no guarantees.

Warped Forests are safer, being mostly empty and whatever moobs there are only
Endermen, who are interested only in taking the nylium.

<h3 id="time-to-farm" o="1.2">Time to Farm</h3>

You are going to get hungry fast and you will have to concern yourself with
food. Dying is the fastest way to replenish hunger, and simultaneously the most
punishing, as well as acting as Chorus Fruit.

Rotten Flesh is (or was) *the* most abundant food, has reliable spawns, but it
has an 80% chance of giving you food poisoning (the hunger effect). It is also a
byproduct of a necessary mob farm. However, it's hard to obtain as they are
dropped from Zombies and Zombie Pigmen, these attacking you as a group in
retaliation.

Chicken is obtainable! But the mob is exceptionally rare (0.25%) as it only
spawns when a baby Pigman (5%) decides to be a Chicken Jockey (5%) and, to
dismay, those chickens do not lay eggs. Poultry is arguably the second best
available food type excluding golden foods.

Porkchop may be your food type of choice, but the big pigs they drop from are
hostile to and are hard-hitters on the player. You need skill and quick thinking
to farm bacon. Hoglins can, however, be pacified by trapping them around Warped
Fungi. Bacon is the best non-golden food available.

Mushroom Stew. Mushroom Stew is the vegetarian's choice, made with Brown and Red
Mushrooms (generated naturally), the only requirement is a wooden bowl. You will
likely eat this when starting. Farming mushrooms is a slow activity, but
absolutely doable.

<h3 id="time-to-mine" o="1.3">Time to Mine</h3>

Netherrack is waste. You can mine Quartz and Gold with just a wooden pickaxe.
Quartz, however, is useless with building and XP being its only uses. Gold armor
is vital for Piglins to not kill you on sight immediately, a single piece will
suffice so adorn yourself with a golden crown. Golden tools are trash though.

Naturally, you'll come across Blackstone splodges, those are your best friend.
Those will grant you stone tools, furnaces, not much on their own but enough for
the classic trio (chest, workbench, furnace). You'll cherish Blackstone deposits
until you have a good Gold farm.

The next tier is *way* beyond what we can achieve in the early game, Ancient
Debris is quite literally unobtanium without Diamonds.

<h3 id="hog-tipper" o="1.4">Hog Tipper</h3>

A basic Hoglin farm is inbound. It will be a deadly task without armor, but only
two Hogs will be needed. Given the fact that Hoglins have *massive* reach,
you're better off tricking pathfinding than have them follow you into a fence
pen. After you get your hogs in, adorn the pen with Warped Fungi. Crimson Fungi
will breed them.

<h3 id="hot-topic" o="1.5">Hot Topic</h3>

Furnaces will be lackluster because none of the wood available is flammable,
although sticks, crafting tables, chests, ladders, tools, bowls, and other
wooden products will do.

They'll be doubly lackluster because, there's very few items in The Nether that
benefit from being cooked. The one you'll cook the most is porkchop, and even
then? Porkchop can be cooked in a soul campfire, effectively for free (if you
consider silence of no value).

<h3 id="into-fire" o="1.6">Into Fire</h3>

Soul Campfires are easily obtainable and are the easiest way to cook food. You
may break Soul Campfires at will, they always drop one Soul Soil. For normal
campfires, given that Crimson and Warped Logs aren't flammable, getting charcoal
will be difficult at first: you need to slay a Wither Skeleton and have them
drop coal. You can then duplicate charcoal using campfires (intended game
mechanic). Also, Blaze Rods are really good furnace fuel.

<h3 id="not-quite-sweet-dreams" o="1.7">Not Quite "Sweet Dreams"</h3>

Once you have a lot of gold, you may wish to barter with Piglins. Their barter
table is very wide, so you'll need a significant amount of gold to be relatively
sure you'll walk away with 6 Crying Obsidian. Harvest some Glowstone and you're
ready to set your spawn. However, do note that it loses charge every time you
die.

Additionally, with Silk Touch being (usually) off-limits, obtaining Glowstone
blocks may be a menial task. Piglins no longer barter them so you have a limited
amount of respawns.

<h3 id="acquire-hardware" o="1.8">Acquire Hardware</h3>

With a considerable amount of gold, you'll have a reasonable amount of iron
nuggets. With 2.18% of barters dropping 10-36 nuggets, they can be quite
expensive. You likely want at least 270 nuggets, enough for one full iron armor,
one iron sword, one bucket and one shield.

Although I say that, you must consider the cost of a single iron ingot compared
to the value you'd be getting out of it. Are you using a mod that increases the
durability of gold tools inside The Nether? Do you have reactions fast enough
that you could use the shield reliably (considering its 0.5s startup)? Do you
have enough Blackstone deposits that stone tools are dirt cheap?

<h2 id="from-racks-to-riches" o="2">From Racks to Riches</h2>

<mark class="note"><b>TO-DO:</b> Elaborate why "never update" and the tragic
consequences of the 1.20 update on the road to Netherite</mark>

<h3 id="cattleman" o="2.1">Cattleman</h3>

Below are my opinions on mob farms, why you should or should not build them.

  - **Blaze farms** are a really good source of XP and fuel. A Blaze spawner can
    also be used a hostile mob switch! But you'll need another player if you
    want to go far away from said switch. These farms are a little tough to
    build, but they are worth the cost.

  - **Chicken farms** will require a **gargantuan** Zombie Pigman farm for it to
    be any useful. So big it can probably lag the server, most likely it's not
    feasible.

  - **Endermen farms** can be written off as unnecessary: the Warped Fungi
    provide plenty of cover for a manual Ender-genocide, Piglins will give you a
    reasonable amount of pearls, and they don't have any use that would require
    thousands of them.

  - **Endermite farms**: reader hit the ground too hard.
  
  - **Ghast farms** are completely possible! The most boring part, however, is
    making a spawn-proof perimeter to increase the rates of said farm. That
    said, they can provide a lot of ghast tears and gunpowder. One's useful for
    regen pots, the other is replaced by beds.

  - **Hoglin spawns farms** are possible too. similarly with the Ghast farm, the
    most menial part is the perimeter or spawn-proofing the area. These can
    provide a lot of already cooked porkchop and leather.

  - **Hoglin breeding farms** should definitely be considered early-game. They
    are easy to build and they provide a reliable source of porkchop, but
    they're fiddly to set up and the entire process is manual.

  - **Magma Cube spawns farms** are relatively easy to build. All you need is a
    basalt delta and a pickaxe. These can potentially be a very good source of
    XP and Magma Cream.

  - **Magma Cube spawner farms**: <abbr title="I don't know">idk</abbr> about them,
    but they could probably be used as an easy mob switch.

<h3 id="crop-farming" o="2.2">Crop Farming</h3>

There are no farmable crops in the traditional sense, but there are ways to farm
non-animal living? things, some are even edible!

  - **Fungus farms** are the hellish tree farms, a requirement basically.
    However, fungi don't naturally grow into giant fungi, you need bonemeal.
    Thankfully if you put the wart blocks of this farm into a composter, you'll
    profit bonemeal.

  - **Nether Wart farm**: wart is needed for potions, but that's about it.
    Farming for wart blocks has become obsolete, and they aren't edible.

  - **Mushroom spreads farm**: is the slowest farm of them all and requires
    quite some maintenance with strict conditions, although... There are designs
    for manual mushroom spreads farms that appear to have decent rates even if
    you only collect mushrooms hourly.

    <mark class="note"><b>TO-DO:</b> Illustrate with mushroom spread farm
    designs</mark>

  - **Mushroom bonemeals farm**: is the fastest farm of them all and requires
    very little maintenance with loose conditions, although... Not all big
    mushrooms will be in a spot that's easy to mine but that's effectively the
    only complaint I have with them.

  - **Carrots and Potatoes?** Zombie Pigmen have a tiny chance of spawning
    *Zombie* reinforcements. These drop carrots and potatoes, but there's no
    dirt in The Nether, which is needed to plant those, there's no way to get
    anything that can be transformed into dirt in The Nether.


<h2 id="major-concerns" o="3">Major Concerns</h2>
<h3 id="diamonds-before-iron" o="3.1">Diamonds! before Acquire Hardware</h3>

Since there are no diamonds in The Nether, the upgrade line is strictly
disjointed, and has two starting points. You literally cannot mine for diamonds.
Likewise, you can get a lucky spawn and find yourself a full diamond set in
fortress and bastion loot. However...

<h3 id="getting-an-upgrade-at-all" o="3.2">Getting an Upgrade at all</h3>

In a modded [Origins mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/origins) Nether-start
playthrough, with my origin set as Blazeborn (fire immunity, strength from being
on fire, but damaged by water, spawned in The Nether), I managed to get by with
just wooden tools, stone sword, and golden armor.

I did not spawn near Basalt Deltas, so I had to rely on barters for Blackstone.
I had bad luck in getting Blackstone, I had some blackstone, a bit over
half-stack, but not enough for me to search and mine for gold ore and barter for
Blackstone sustainably with stone tools. I *had* to rely on wooden tools.

<h3 id="iron-deficiency-anemia" o="3.3">Iron Deficiency Anemia</h3>

Continuing the hook of my playthrough from my last point, I managed to get 12
obsidian alright, but I only managed to get some 80 iron nuggets, three ingots
were used to craft a shield and two flint and steel (in this case used for a
temporary boost in attack strength). I had considered upgrading from leather
armor to iron, but I didn't get enough iron from barters before I first left The
Nether.

<h3 id="theres-no-food-in-the-nether" o="3.4">There's no food in The Nether</h3>

In the old Nether, while your only options were dangerously gotten Rotten Flesh
and Mushroom Stew, you could find both types of mushrooms without walking too
much. Now however, with the luminous Basalt Deltas, skeleton-infested Soul Sand
Valleys, Warped and Crimson infestations, the original mushrooms became
difficult to find. Also, the "Nether food" of 1.16 proves difficult to slay its
bearer.

Despite how much I meme jeb_ for claiming there was no food in The Nether before
the update, Mojang nerfed gathering for food in The Nether.

The earlier stages of survival are a question of hunger management - hiding from
hostile mobs, no sprinting, mining the bare essentials, as well as looking for
food. Hoglins are difficult to fight against on a level field with basic gear —
they're still annoying even with late game gear. The only way to safely cheese
it is to build a 3 tall pillar, 2 high pillars are not good enough because of
their extended range. Plus, you'll *have* to sneak in order to be able to hit
any hogs and they also have to be pretty much on you. By geometry alone, it's
difficult to land critical hits on one stationary hoglin, let alone a couple of
them tracking you down and pushing each other about.

the slippery slope.</mark>

<h2 id="4">Datapacks - to be reviewed</h2>

<h3><a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/incendium-nether-expansion/">Incendium</h3>
<p>planet minecraft link</a>, absolute bonkers.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/austin-s-nether-survival/">Netherbound</h3>
<p>planet minecraft link</a>, adorn-esque datapack, worth checking out.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/netherlands-v1-0-10-new-nether-biomes-1-16-2-experimental-world-gen/">Netherlands</h3>
<p>planet minecraft link</a>, appears to be world-gen only.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/no-verworld-nether-survival-reimagined-full-release/">No-verworld</h3>
<p>planet minecraft link</a>, feels a little strawberry (chocolate but botched attempt at vanilla).</p>

<h2 id="5">Datapack Suggestions</h2>
<em>Mojang, add NBT crafting please!!!</em>

<h3>Quartz Tools and Armor</h3>
<p>Quartz is plentiful in The Nether underground but have no uses except building. This datapack would provide tools, armor and their recipes using quartz as the main material (requiring a resource pack).</p>
<p>The tools can be stone tools with custom model data 2, using a non-italicized translation key for the name, allowing vanilla resource packs to set quartz pickaxes to look quartzy. This is impossible in vanilla as functions in shaped crafting results are not supported.</p>
<p>Chainmail armor, since it's uncraftable to, is a prime target. Quartz armor can replace chainmail in textures and translation keys. Changing the furnacing and blasting recipes will be needed (else iron from Quartz?).</p>

<h3>More Nether Foods</h3>
<img src="/assets/screenshots/warped_food_thing.png" class="small fr pad">
<p>Mushroom Stew, but aren't crimson and warped fungi also mushrooms? Possible ideas include crimson fungi and crimson roots to a crimson stew replacing beetroot soup, warped fungus and warped roots to a warped soup, replacing rabbit stew. Maybe also strider meat? Raw mutton becoming "frostbitten glutton" and cooked mutton just "raw glutton".</p>
<p>Another, more plausible idea I had was a crop that acts somewhat like melon. You plant it on soul soil, it grows like wheat, and instead of a stem curving onto a block and then placing a full block, the crop turns into a full block, and then turn into a block that's actually edible.</p>

<h3>Netherrack Pickaxe and Tools</h3>
<p>A golden pickaxe with Unbreaking 3 and hidden enchantment tags, custom model data 1. Remember to name it with a translation key, unitalicized, and color reset!</p>

<h3>PIGPOG</h3>
<p>Make pigs spawn in wastes, albeit rarely. If Zombie Pigmen are Piglins that have gone to the overworld and came back, what about the Hoglin's peaceful cousin?</p>

<h2 id="6">Datapacks - A Thin Line in the Sand</h2>
<p>Since we're on the topic of datapacks and NBT data and <i>literally adding new items</i> in a way that's reasonably compatible with vanilla, I must ask: at what point does it stop being vanilla? Crafting items with NBT data requires mods, but even if it was possible, would it really be vanilla? At what point does it stop being vanilla and it becomes modded? Surely one or two items to help solve smaller issue wouldn't stray the game very far from vanilla, but on the other hand we have Incendium, we also could have data packs that adds stuff from outside the Nether and they would look and feel completely out of place.</p>
<p>In my honest opinion, any Nether mods stop being vanilla when it either doesn't follow the vanilla theme on a broader level, or it lets you do things that are only possible outside of the Nether, as well as things that fall in the uncanny valley. In other words, a datapack that adds literally ice and frosty biomes to the Nether breaks vanilla. Another mod that breaks vanilla is <a href="https://modrinth.com/mod/cinderscapes">Cinderscapes, by Prospector</a>, nothing against them, but it doesn't fit the hot wasteland of vanilla, too colorful.</p> -->
