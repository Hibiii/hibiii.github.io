The boats have eyes. They do not perceive anything with said eyes, other than a
harmless water height check when determining if the boat should sink.

Armor Stands are living things. It's easier to make something that has all the
properties of living things and mostly reacts in a way that a living thing would
out of a living entity than not.

Buying an item from a villager is the same as crafting one. The callback for an
item being crafted is called, so if you're a mod developer, you cannot expect
the player to actually be crafting.

Any item with a maximum stack size of 1 is automatically elligible for
enchantments, even if none are applicable to it. Additionally, any item that can
be damaged are automatically elligible for the unbreaking and mending
enchantments.

Nether Wart blocks (regardless of crimsom or warped) are mostly spawnproof in
The Nether. This is a measure to prevent Piglins and Hoglins from spawning stuck
on a giant fungus. Ghasts and Magma Cubes can still spawn on them as they can
fly or jump away without taking damage.

In-game GUIs (from entities, blocks, etc), have a default size of 176 pixels
wide by 166 high, before scaling.
