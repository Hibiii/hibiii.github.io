<p>A Fabric mod that adds a HUD specifically for boating.</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hibiii/BoatHud/main/.github/screenshot.png" class="big">
<p>This HUD was designed more for boat racing, but it should be 100% usable for casual boating around water. Configuration is done through Mod Menu. Displayed info includes: speed, drift angle, acceleration, and inputs. I took a bit of inspiration from the F1 games. :) Pls don't sue EA</p>
<p>This mod is the pride of software engineering for me! Its pre-release life followed a very quick and by-the-book development cycle: a vision, a concept, rapid prototyping, and polishing for release all under two weeks.</p>
<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<p><b>HUD Details:</b> A reference sheet is included:</p>

<p><b>Regarding Quilt & Fabric:</b> Boat&ZeroWidthSpace;Hud satisfies a very niche audience. While Quilt exclusivity was intended, Fabric will continue to be supported, because otherwise, it'd hurt the already small community of people that race Minecraft boats on ice.</p>
