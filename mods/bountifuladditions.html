<p>I have a computer with Windows XP installed on it, and theoretically I can run Minecraft all the way up to 21w18a, but I've had no luck in getting the world to generate post 1.13. I figured that, since it's already running an old and outdated operating system, an old and outdated version of Minecraft to accompany would be a-ok! I'm not putting it on CurseForge or Modrinth because I don't think there are a lot of people deliberately playing on 1.8.9.</p>
