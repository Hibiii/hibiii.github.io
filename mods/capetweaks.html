<p>Cape&ZeroWidthSpace;Tweaks is a small mod for vanilla capes. It does not add any new capes.</p>
<p>With Cape&ZeroWidthSpace;Tweaks you can smooth their movement, or have them not show up at all! You can also toggle if elytra can have the cape texture. Additionally, you can also hide specific capes, like Minecon capes and migration capes!</p>
<p>Cape&ZeroWidthSpace;Tweaks does <i>not</i> add OptiFine capes. For that, see <a href="/mods/kappa">Kappa</a>. Cape&ZeroWidthSpace;Tweaks also isn't guaranteed to work with any modded cape.</p>
<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<p><b>Regarding Quilt:</b> Cape&ZeroWidthSpace;Tweaks will support Quilt once I'm comfortable with porting mods to it. Fabric support will secondary, and may be dropped.</p>
