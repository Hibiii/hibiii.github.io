<h2 id="1">Intent</h2>
<p>The Blåhaj Mod was designed to bring the comfort of cuddling your favorite plushie into Minecraft. If there is any plushie you'd like to see added, let me know!</p>

<h2 id="2">How to use</h2>
<p>The requirements for Blåhaj Mod are Quilt Loader, and Fabric API, and is required on <i>both</i> the server and client. If you only play in singleplayer, it only needs to be installed once. If you are a server operator, you need to install it on the server, and tell your players to install it on their games as well.</p>
<p>Fabric API is embedded in Quilt Standard Libraries, and is aptly branded "Quilted Fabric API". If you already have QSL installed (which Quilt mods are likely to themselves require), then you don't need to install Fabric API.</p>

<h2 id="3">Version support</h2>
<p>The Blåhaj Mod always targets the latest version of the video game. If there is demand for a specific version, it shall be supported until it wains (very little downloads after a prolonged amount of time).</p>
<p>Forge will not be supported due to not only profound loader differences, but also insecurity as a platform. Unless you are willing to take on the burden of continually developing and maintaining for it, do not make a pull request adding support for Forge.</p>

<h2 id="4">Items</h2>
<p>All items added by this mod, whenever you craft, trade for, or rename, get your username attached to them. The player will also do a hugging pose when it is in either hand, and mining blocks directly with these items on the main hand will make mining 4 times slower because they are soft.</p>

<h3 id="4.1">Soft Toy Shark</h3>
<p>Also known as the Blåhaj, this is a soft, shark-shaped plushie that the player can hold on their hands. It has no practical use and is purely cosmetic. Its ID is <code>blahaj:blue_shark</code>. Blåhaj can obtained only by crafting, using a vaguely shark-shaped recipe:</p>

<h3 id="4.2">Gray Toy Shark</h3>
<p>Also known as the Klappar Haj, this is a gray version of the Blåhaj, and represents a much older version of Blåhaj, previously sold at IKEA. It is identical in every other way. Its ID is <code>blahaj:gray_shark</code>. It can obtained only by trading with sheperd villagers at master level, or in chests of village houses in plains, taiga, and snow biomes, or in stronghold chests.</p>

<h3 id="4.3">Bread Pillow</h3>
<p>This is a long, baguette shaped item that is also purely cosmetic. It represents various bread-themed pillows sold at various stores. Its ID is <code>blahaj:bread</code>. It can be obtained by crafting, using a vaguely bread-shaped recipe of orange wool:</p>

<h2 id="5">Technical Reference</h2>
<p>This section includes more implementational details. Any vanilla field and method names will be using <a href="https://github.com/QuiltMC/quilt-mappings">Quilt mapping names</a> as they're unencumbered.</p>

<h3 id="5.1">Cuddly item</h3>
<p>This is the class common to all items defined by this mod. It defines the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Receiving and storing a "subtitle" when it is initialized in the code (constructor declaration);</li>
	<li>The NBT key for the username of the "owner", <code>CuddlyItem.OWNER_KEY = "Owner"</code>;</li>
	<li>How to attach the "owner"'s username when it is crafted (<code>onCraft</code> override, place NBT <code>{Owner:"&lt;username&gt;"}</code> in the resulting ItemStack);</li>
	<li>Attaching a tooltip to an ItemStack if it has a subtitle or the ItemStack has an "owner", and appropriately so if it is renamed (<code>appendTooltip</code> override);</li>
	<li>Divide the mining speed when using a cuddly item to mine by four (<code>getMiningSpeedMultiplier</code> override).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Displaying the username of the owner</h4>
<p>Cuddly items can display the item of the "owner". This is an entirely cosmetic feature and does not affect gameplay.</p>
<p>Since there's no ownership system in Minecraft, it uses the same trick as written books do, by storing the username in NBT and displaying in the tooltip. Items that have been crafted or renamed will have the username of the player that crafted or renamed it had at the time of doing so. There is no way to remove a displayed name from an item.</p>
<p>Knowing this, under normal survival play, only three states are possible for any cuddly item:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<th></th>
		<th>Unnamed</th>
		<th>Renamed</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>With owner tag</th>
		<td>Yes</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Without owner tag</th>
		<td>Possible with Klappar Haj;<br>impossible otherwise</td>
		<td>Impossible</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h3 id="5.2">Loot table additions</h3>
<p>For better integration with the vanilla world generation, the Blåhaj mod adds an entry to a few chests in that are generated in the world.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Stronghold crossing</b> and <b>Stronghold corridor chests</b>: 1 Klappar Haj is placed in the chest with a 5/100 chance per chest;</li>
	<li><b>Plains village house chest</b>: 1 Klappar Haj is placed in the chest with a 1/43 chance per chest;</li>
	<li><b>Taiga</b> and <b>Snowy village house chests</b>: 1 Klappar Haj is placed in the chest with a 5/54 chance per chest;</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5.3">Villager trade offer additions</h3>
<p>In order to make Klappar Hajs not a finite resource, it's also available as a villager trade.</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Level</b>: Master</li>
	<li><b>Price</b>: 15 emeralds</li>
	<li><b>Multiplier</b>: 0.1</li>
	<li><b>Selling</b>: 1 Gray Toy Shark</li>
	<li><b>Limit before restock</b>: 2 trades</li>
	<li><b>Villager XP</b>: 30 xp</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5.4">Mixins</h3>
<p>To complete the functionality of the mod, as well as preventing bugs, mixins were used. The functionality of each is explained below, in a logical order:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h4><code>PlayerEntityRenderer</code></h4>
		<p>This mixin ensures the player has the <code>CROSSBOW_HOLD</code> arm pose. It takes control of both arms, and points them where the player is looking at. It is similar to how normal bows are held, but has an easier injection point, and makes the render code for normal items (vast majority) untouched.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><code>BipedEntityModel</code></h4>
		<p>This mixin turns the arms down and inwards regardless of pitch if the player holds a cuddly item. The injection point insures that the code is only run when the player's pose is a crossbow hold.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><code>AnvilScreenHandler</code></h4>
		<p>This mixin makes sure that the renamer's username is stored when a cuddly item is renamed, doing so exactly the same as when it is crafted. Additionally, there's a supporting mixin into <code>ForgingScreenHandler</code> giving this one access to the player field.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h4><code>AllayEntity</code></h4>
		<p>This mixin prevents players giving Allays a cuddly item. This prevents a bug where the Allay would hold sharks through its head. On later examination, it was found that this change prevented players from accidentally giving an Allay the item if they were holding it on their off-hand.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6">Known issues</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Hibiii/Blahaj/issues/9">GH-9: Bread pillow recipe is too generic</a>: the shape of the recipe is so vague that there might be conflicts with other mods, it is the same shape as stone walls and wooden trapdoors. The solution for this will be adding a bread without consuming it, once an easy enough solution for recipe remainders becomes available.</p>
