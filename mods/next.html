description: A couple of ideas for my next mod thrown around

---
<p>This is not an actual mod. This page only contains ideas for a future mod, which I haven't started work on.</p>
<h2>Gameplay Additions</h2>
<p>These ideas, while they may be 100% compatible with the other side of the client-server paradigm, is just, different. Any clientside mods aren't guaranteed to not trip anticheats, but are less likely.</p>
<h3>Clientside Effects</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Heat Stroke</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Caused by sun exposure, hot biomes, and merely existing in The Nether, as well as being on fire<sup>(1)</sup></li>
			<li>Symptoms are slowness, nausea, weakness and mining fatigue</li>
			<li>Treated by water bottles, fire resistance, and items that provide shade<sup>(2)</sup></li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>1</b>: Technically, heat stroke would only be inflicted upon being extinguished because adrenaline of being on fire and all. <b>2</b>: Items that provide shade are to be set with a resource pack. In one of my resource packs, the Totem of Undying is an umbrella uwu.</p>
	</li>
	<li><b>Cold</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Caused by swimming in cold biomes, being too high in the world, outdoors at night in cold biomes, as well as deep, dark, and narrow caves, and receiving rain without a shade</li>
			<li>Symptom is pretty much the freezing effect, but no actual hurting</li>
			<li>Treated by standing next to fire, next to insulation (wool) and wearing leather armor</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Clientside Origins</h3>
<p>Origins mod but instead of being serverside with client integration, it's just on the client. <b>Obviously it will not give you powers</b>, only the negatives. “<i>WHY USE IT THEN</i>” I hear you ask. It adds to the roleplay aspect if you want to have one! Videogames don't need to be balanced 100% of the time and be played for their mechanics, but rather, they should be played to have fun.</p>
